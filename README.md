# Credit Card Attrition

The topic of this project is predicting attrition of credit card customers based on the data that we have about their credit card usage. This will allow banks to reach out to users likely to close their account and offer incentives to stay.

We hope to pinpoint why users leave their accounts and who credit card customers should be targeting their outreach towards.
